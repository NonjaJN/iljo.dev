<b>studying:</b>
<br />
how do I study better?
<br />
Practice, like any skill you need to hone it and develop it over a period of time. And that involves a lot of studing and working. Don't push yourself to hard, otherwise you will get burn out. You need to strike the balance between pushing yourself hard enough to get peak improvement and not working to hard.
